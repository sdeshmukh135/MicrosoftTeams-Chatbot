# MicrosoftTeams-Chatbot
Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 API to create automated responses to questions asked on Microsoft Teams
Uses an HTTP Request after testing code in Azure to link the code (already integrated with OpenAI) to Power Automate
Power Automate takes input from Microsoft Teams message body and outputs into a message reply
